 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 *  The dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) is a systematic extension beyond the single site approximation of 
 *  dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) to include spatially non-local correlation in quantum many-body simulations. 
 *  The method relies on effective solvers of the many-body problem on the cluster with $N_c$ sites. The recently 
 *  developed continuous time auxiliary field (CTAUX) algorithm has proven particularly effective for DCA simulations, 
 *  as it does not suffer from time discretization problems of the Hirsch-Fye algorithm. CTAUX can be formulated in 
 *  combination with sub-matrix updates in order to map optimally onto modern processors with hierarchical 
 *  memory architectures. Further algorithmic improvements, such as a modified FFT algorithm to efficiently deal 
 *  with the random times, or high-frequency conditioning of the Matsubara sums allow us to further reduce the 
 *  overall computational effort and improve scalability of the overall method. It is now possibly to routinely 
 *  run quantum cluster simulations with 100+ sites on thousands or tens of thousands of CPU cores, and thereby 
 *  reach the asymptotic limit in the computation of physically observable quantities.

 * \section install_sec Installation
 *
 * \subsection step1 Step 1: Opening the box ...
 * 
 *  Open a shell at the directory "/DCAMOMS++/build/prog_dca++" and type "python generate_dca.py". A menu will open up
 *  and one selects the desired configuration modes. The main.cpp and Makefile will then be generated in the directory
 *  "/DCAMOMS++/build/bin". If you dont know what to pick, type "enter". It will pick the default pick.
 *
 * \subsection step2 Step 2: Install the libraries
 *
 *  Go to the bin directory and type into the shell "make FFTW; make NFFT; make LEVMAR; make SPGLIB". The libraries will be 
 *  generated in the DCAMOMS directory (so locally) and thus not interfere with installations on the root.  
 *
 * \subsection step3 Step 3: Compiling the code
 *
 * Go to the bin directory and type into the shell "make". This will generate the executable "dcaqmcMPI" and "analysiscode".
