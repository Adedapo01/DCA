# DCA++

Providing a state of the art implementation of the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) and its DCA<sup>+</sup> extension, DCA++ delivers insight into the fascinating physics of strongly correlated electron systems. 
Scalability and efficiency combined with portable performance allows to make optimal use of systems at all scales, from workstations to leadership computers. 
Sustainable and scalable development within the project is achieved by adopting standard techniques of the software industry such as test driven development and continuous integration.
